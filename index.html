				<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<img src="media/images/profile.webp" alt="soweli" id="profile_pic">
				<p>My name is The Dressed Mole-Rat, <abbr data-title="My name in toki pona">soweli Awa</abbr>, or <abbr data-title="My other name in toki pona">jan Awa</abbr>, and I'm 17 years old and Swedish. I enjoy languages, typography, programming<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma">,</a> and math(s). This website is where I put fun things I want strangers to see.</p>
				<img src="media/images/memes/guy.gif" alt="cat-gif" class="right">			
				<p>The real normal person languages I know are Swedish and English, and <abbr data-title="I learned it in school but can't really carry a conversation">almost French</abbr>. I am however also fluent in the constructed language <a href="#toki pona">toki pona</a>, and I enjoy everything there is to consume in the language. Generally, I think grammar and phonetics are interesting too, and I am currently making a conlang. (By currently making, I mean sometimes adding a word and then forgetting about it for a while)</p>
				<img src="media/images/memes/hamer-min.gif" alt="cat-gif" class="left">			
				<p>I also enjoy ambigrams. Most people, however, don't seem to know what they are, so <abbr data-title="This is technically reference to s2e1-14:07 of the Swedish comedy show Dips...">boy let me tell ya</abbr>. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram">ambigram</a> is a typographical thing you can do where a word (or phrase) can be read in multiple ways. Most commonly, an ambigram is a word that's written weirdly, so you can turn it upside down and still read it. A <abbr data-title="Known as a 'symbiotogram'">funner version</abbr> of that is when you turn it and it says something else! I both make and regularly look at ambigrams, because they are so fun. If you want examples of really good ambigrams, check out the <a href="https://ambigr.am/hall-of-fame">ambigr.am hall of fame</a>! (I've also made <a href="ambigenerator/">a generator</a> that produces sometimes readable ambigrams)</p>			
				<img src="media/images/memes/lick.gif" alt="cat-gif" class="right">			
				<p>I'm also really interested in fonts! I'm not a good font maker (I've only made bitmap fonts and modified some actual ones), but it's fun to identify them and to watch lengthy Youtube videos about them and typography in general.</p>			
				<p>When it comes to computers I'm not the best, (I still use windows and ios ew), but I know enough HTML and CSS to for example make this website. I have also made things in Python, C#, as well as weird freaky languages like Brainfuck and Javascript.</p>				
				<p>I spend most of my free time watching Youtube or coding things in Python or Godot. I sometimes play one of a few video games, including minecraft and Zelda. In ascending order of my enjoyment, the Zelda games I've beaten are: <abbr data-title="I got really frustrated with the unclear objectives and didn't really appreciate the good parts">Ocarina of Time</abbr>, <abbr data-title="Really good game, but I didn't like the main quests">Tears of the Kingdom</abbr>, <abbr data-title="It's not very good but it was very fun">The Adventure of Link</abbr>, and <abbr data-title="I wish I could play it for the first time again!">Breath of the Wild</abbr>. I also like going on walks in the Swedish forest, where I look at and listen to birds a lot! I always bring binoculars because I love identifying both constellations and birds. I drink two to five cups of <abbr data-title="Only black tea, I don't really like other ones">tea</abbr> per day. (yum)</p>

				<h2>toki pona</h2>
				<img src="media/images/memes/doh-min.webp" alt="homer meme" class="right">
				<p>There are around 130 words in toki pona. This means every word has quite a broad meaning, and that you often have to combine words to mean something. <abbr data-title="󱥪">"telo"</abbr> for example means "liquid" broadly, but in context, it often means water or soda or anything that's relevant in the conversation. You can always try to be as specific as you are in a natural language, but the details are often not important, so you often just don't say them.</p>			
				<img src="media/images/memes/sigma-min.webp" alt="drew gooden meme" class="left">
				<p>The birth of toki pona took place in 2001. A Canadian woman named <abbr data-title="Sonja Lang in English, 󱤑󱦐󱥡󱦜󱥁󱤑󱦜󱦑 in toki pona">Sonja</abbr> was depressed, so she invented a minimalist language with a total of 120 words (as you do). After she published the language online, people started learning and using it. Since then it has evolved, and now, toki pona has 139 official words, and maybe a couple thousand speakers? (Based on the discord server members)</p>
