		<h2>Cryptic crossword clues</h2>
		<p>There's a game called <a href="https://www.minutecryptic.com/">Minute Cryptic</a> and it's really fun. It's based on a thing called Cryptic crosswords, which are like crosswords but the clues are really cryptic. There are rules to how they work that are pretty difficult to learn, but basically there's a definition somewhere in the clue that's a synonym ish of the answer, and some wordplay you have to do to get the answer. There's a <a href="https://www.minutecryptic.com/guide">tutorial</a> that's more in depth. Minute Cryptic is just a NYT-style daily game where they make one Cryptic crossword clue per day. I've been playing it for a while, and now I've also made some clues of my own.</p>

		<p>These are placed in order of creation. Perhaps that means they're also in ascending order of quality, but that's not for me to say...</p>

		<p>Click the links to get clues. Also no, I will not give you the answers.</p>
