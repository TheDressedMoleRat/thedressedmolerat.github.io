	<h2>Facts I've learned recently</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="date">2026-01-02</span>: Academy Awards is just the official name of the Oscars! I thought it was something else!</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-12-18</span>: There's a British mush food called <abbr data-title="I don't know if writing it here counts as saying it, but anyways I can say it because I'm a fag myself :3">Faggot</abbr></li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-11-17</span>: As and Ass aren't homophones...</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-10-11</span>: The Nato phonetic alphabet is actually based on a lot of research and testing to avoid similar sounding words. I assumed it was mostly vibes.</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-09-15</span>: CTRL+INSERT and SHIFT+INSERT are alternatives to CTRL+C and CTRL+V</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-08-19</span>: The reason why second (time) and second (number two) are the same word is not a coincidence. It's because the Romans(?) divided the hour into minutes, called "the first subdivision" (pars minuta prima), and seconds called "the second subdivision" (pars minuta secunda). For minutes, the "minuta" part stuck, and for seconds the "secunda" part did.</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-08-12</span>: TV-tropes originally only categorized tropes in Buffy the Vampire Slayer</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-08-05</span>: Did any typewriters exist that could print variable-width aka proportional text? Yes apparently :)</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-08-04</span>: Why is Eiffel pronounced <span class="ipa">/'ajfel/</span> in English as if it were German, instead of <span class="ipa">/e'fel/</span> or <span class="ipa">/ej'fel/</span> as if it were French? Ok it's because the surname is German and English speakers must have already been saying <span class="ipa">/'ajfel/</span> before Gustave built that tower so they didn't bother changing to his pronounciation.</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-08-02</span>: Buckets only stack to 16</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-07-18</span>: That's what Kepler said, but according to <a href="https://www.ips-planetarium.org/page/a_jacobsen2001">modern science</a> he died of bad medicine, which he took because his bladder was bad, which started when he held his pee for too long, but maybe not because of it, but maybe.</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-07-17</span>: Tycho Brahe died because he held his pee for too long because "etiquette"</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-07-17</span>: Supernovas are called nova because people Tycho Brahe understandably thought of them as *new* stars</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-07-28</span>: Did any glitches actually occur because of y2k? Yeah kinda: Several babies were born at 100 years old, a Korean video store sent a fee of 8 million won for a rental which was 100 years overdue, 10% of Greece's receipts said 1900, a kindergarten in Norway offered a spot to a 105 year old woman, a hospital thought 154 women were over 100 years old which put them at risk for having children with Down syndrome which led to two abortions, and the US official standard date was briefly 1 Jan 19100.</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-07-27</span>: There's a crazy script called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamum_script">Bamum</a> that a king in Cameroon around 1900 made</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-07-21</span>: There's a fun Unicode block called Symbols for Legacy Computing which includes among others: Stick figure with dress 🯉, left half running man 🮲, and middle third white right pointing index 🯂</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-07-14</span>: Basically all black and green tea is just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camellia_sinensis">one plant</a></li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-07-11</span>: The inventor of scrabble was named Butts</li>
		<li><span class="date">2025-06-04</span>: The king of hearts is often depicted with his sword in his head and is called the suicide king</li>
